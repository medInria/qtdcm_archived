1 - Presentation
================

QtDcm implements a Qt widget in order to manipulate Dicom data. With QtDcm, it is now possible
to explore a Dicom CD-ROM, to query a PACS (Pictures Archive and Communications System) and
to convert series of images to the nifti format.
Due to its modular design, QtDcm is very easy to integrate in other application (see the example
in the code).

2 - Installation
================

QtDcm requires :
 - CMake (version 2.6 and later),
 - Qt (version 4.5 and later),
 - Dcmtk (version 3.6.0 and later).
The conversion of Dicom data to Nifti format is based (for the moment) on a command line tool
<<dcm2nii>>. This tool can be downloaded from the mricron website
(http://www.cabiatl.com/mricro/mricron/dcm2nii.html).
